    "1. **Document Storage & Embeddings:** Medical knowledge documents are converted into embeddings using **HuggingFace's MiniLM** and stored in **FAISS** for quick retrieval.  \n",
    "2. **Query Processing:** The chatbot receives a user query, which may be in different languages. If needed, it translates the query into English.  \n",
    "3. **Multi-Query Retrieval:** Instead of fetching a single document, multiple variations of the query are generated to improve search results.  \n",
    "4. **Similarity Search:** FAISS retrieves the most relevant documents based on the query.  \n",
    "5. **Reranking:** Retrieved documents are reranked using a **Cross-Encoder model** to prioritize the most relevant ones.  \n",
    "6. **Contextual Answer Generation:** A prompt is crafted with the retrieved medical knowledge, and a **large language model (Google Gemini)** generates a well-structured response.  \n",
    "7. **Refinement & Formatting:** The output is further refined, ensuring clarity and correctness.  \n",
    "8. **Multilingual Support:** If the original query was non-English, the chatbot translates the response back to the user‚Äôs language.  \n",
    "9. **Final Response Output:** The chatbot presents the response in an easy-to-read format with structured medical advice.  \n",
    "10. **Iterative Learning:** The system continuously improves by storing user interactions and updating the knowledge base as needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures **accurate, well-structured, and personalized medical insights** for users. üöÄ"

However,  the statement that thyroid issues are \"unlikely to be the sole cause of prolonged leg swelling\" is a bit strong.  While it's true that other causes should be investigated, hypothyroidism *can* contribute significantly to edema, especially when combined with other factors.  The phrasing could be more nuanced to avoid potentially dismissing a relevant contributing factor.  The list of causes is good, but could benefit from mentioning specific examples of medications that can cause edema (e.g., NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Clinical Relevance (9/10):** The response directly addresses the user's concern about leg swelling in relation to a thyroid condition.  It appropriately highlights the need to investigate other potential causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Actionability (8/10):** The response provides clear guidance on when to seek immediate medical attention.  However, the advice on \"soon\" could be more specific (e.g., \"within 24-48 hours\").  The treatment options are appropriately presented as dependent on the underlying cause, but could benefit from slightly more detail on self-care measures that can be taken while awaiting a diagnosis (e.g., elevating legs).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Comprehensiveness (9/10):** The response covers the major aspects: symptoms, causes, when to seek care, and treatment options. However,  it could benefit from a brief mention of diagnostic tests that might be used to determine the cause of the leg swelling (e.g., ultrasound for DVT, blood tests for kidney function).  Adding a section on preventative measures, where relevant (e.g., weight management for heart failure-related edema), would enhance comprehensiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall:** The response is a good starting point but could be refined for greater precision and completeness.  The self-critical analysis highlights the need for more nuanced language and the inclusion of additional details to improve its clinical utility and patient safety.\n",

      "Final Answer: Leg swelling (edema) can have many causes, and it's important to determine the underlying reason.  While your mother's thyroid issue might contribute to some fluid retention, it's unlikely to be the sole cause of prolonged leg swelling.  Other potential causes must be investigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Symptoms (relevant to leg swelling):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Common:** Leg swelling (edema), especially in the ankles and feet.  This can worsen after prolonged standing or sitting.\n",
      "* **Less Common:**  Discoloration of the skin on the legs, pain in the legs,  weight gain, puffy eyelids.\n",
      "* **Dangerous (‚òÖ):** Sudden onset of severe leg swelling, especially with pain, redness, or warmth in the leg. This could indicate a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) ‚Äî a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention.\n",

      "**When to Seek Care:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Immediately:** If your mother experiences sudden, severe leg swelling, particularly with pain, redness, or warmth in the affected leg.  Seek emergency care immediately, as this could indicate a DVT.\n",

      "\n",
      "Several conditions can cause leg swelling, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Blood clots (DVT):** Blood clots in the leg veins can impede blood flow, leading to fluid buildup.\n",
      "* **Weakened veins (varicose veins):** Weak vein walls or valves can allow blood to pool in the legs.\n",
      "* **Infection or inflammation:** Infections or inflammatory conditions in the leg can cause swelling.\n",
      "* **Lymphedema:** Blockage of lymph channels can prevent proper fluid drainage.\n",
      "* **Other medical conditions:**  Heart failure, kidney disease, liver disease, and certain medications can also contribute to edema.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Treatment Options (for leg swelling):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment depends entirely on the underlying cause.  Addressing the thyroid issue may help with some fluid retention, but it won't address other potential causes of leg swelling.  Your mother needs further evaluation to determine the cause of her leg swelling.  Possible treatments include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Compression stockings:** To improve blood flow and reduce swelling.\n",
      "* **Medications:** Depending on the cause (e.g., antibiotics for infection, blood thinners for DVT).\n",
